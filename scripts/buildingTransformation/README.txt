# Transform location of building
The scripts located in the current directory were used to transform the location of the FZKHouse to the field in front of the bundestag. Internally the python package `pymap3d` is used. In the file `moveHouseToNewLocation.py` the geodetic-coordinates (spherical coordinates) are transformed into the north-east-down (NED)-frame (cartesian coordinates). That is done for each point specified in the KML-file.
To calculate the new posistion, the new location has to be specified in spherical-coordinates in the `moveToLocation`-list structure. These coordinates can be obtained from the cesium-viewer or from goolge-maps. As the `referencePoint` the current coordinates at which the building is located can be inserted. 
Since we had problems understanding the coordinate system in which the FZK-House was, we did a iterative process and changed the `moveToLocation`-coordinates as long until the house was at the desired location.

The FZK-house was also located above the ground. To change used the transformAltitudeScript.py. The number of meters to move the building down can be specified in the variable `meterToMoveDown`. The script can also be executed multiple times until the building is located on the ground.
